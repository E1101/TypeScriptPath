/**
 * Fa√ßade is a pattern that also wraps one or more interfaces and
 * hides the complexities of using complex workflows under a simpler interface.
 *
 * When you have some workflows that need to be orchestrated in a specific manner,
 * such as calling one service and then the other under certain criteria, it's quite
 * tricky to bring this logic across your components every time. With this pattern,
 * you hide all those complexities behind an API and offer a simpler, more readable
 * way to call those workflows. In simple terms, you use a function to wrap many service
 * calls together so that the client will call it with fewer parameters.

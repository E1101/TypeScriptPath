    If we compile this TypeScript code, we will generate the following error:
        error TS2304: Cannot find name 'CONTACT_EMAIL_ARRAY'

    This error indicates that TypeScript does not know anything about the variable
    named CONTACT_EMAIL_ARRAY. It does not even know that it is an array. Remember
    that this array is a global variable and only exists once the HTML page is
    up and running.

    To solve our compilation problem, and make this CONTACT_EMAIL_ARRAY variable
    visible to TypeScript, we will make use of a declaration file. Let's create a
    file named globals.d.ts, that has the special `.d.ts` extension.

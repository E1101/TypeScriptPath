what if we would like to write some code that will work with any sort of type, or any sort of interface or class definition? Perhaps a function that needs to find an element in a list, where the list could be made of strings, or numbers, or any other type. This is where generics come into play. Generics provide a mechanism to write code that does not need to specify a specific type. It is left up to the caller of these generic functions or classes to specify the type that the generic will be working with.

As an example, suppose that we wanted to write a function that iterates over a given array of objects, and returns a concatenation of their values. So, given a list of numbers, say `[1,2,3]`, it should return the string `"1,2,3"`. Or, given a list of strings, say `["first", "second", "third"]`, it should return the string `"first, second, third"`.
